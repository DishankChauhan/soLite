# SolaText - Phase 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 3 of SolaText adds several important features to enhance the functionality and security of the SMS-based Solana wallet:

1. **SPL Token Support** - Expanded beyond SOL and USDC to support multiple SPL tokens
2. **Contact Management** - Enhanced with better formatting and error handling
3. **Security Enhancements** - Added PIN protection and 2FA options
4. **Transaction Notifications** - Added real-time alerts for incoming/outgoing transactions

## Database Schema Updates

- Added `supported_tokens` table to manage multiple SPL tokens
- Added `notification_queue` table to handle transaction notifications
- Updated `users` table with notification preferences and 2FA settings
- Enhanced `transactions` table to support various token types

## New Services

- Functions for retrieving token balances, metadata, and adding new tokens

### Notification Service
- `notificationService.ts` - Handles user notifications
- Queue-based architecture for reliable delivery
- User preference settings for different notification types

## Enhanced Security

### Two-Factor Authentication
- Added `ENABLE 2FA` and `DISABLE 2FA` commands
- SMS-based verification code delivery
- PIN requirement before enabling 2FA

### PIN Protection
- Enhanced PIN validation logic
- Security notifications for PIN-related events

## New Commands

- `TOKENS` - Lists all supported SPL tokens
- `NOTIFICATIONS ON/OFF <type>` - Controls notification preferences

## Webhook API

Added webhook endpoints for:

## Future Improvements

Potential Phase 4 features:
- Localization and language support
- Recovery mechanisms (seed phrase backup)
- Auto-conversion features (token swaps)
- Usage analytics and rate limiting
- Integration with DEXs for token swaps

## Testing

To test the new features:
1. Set up a supported token: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/webhook/add-token -d '{"mintAddress":"TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS", "symbol":"TOKEN", "name":"Token Name", "decimals":9, "apiKey":"your-webhook-api-key"}'`
2. View supported tokens: Send `TOKENS` via SMS
3. Configure notifications: Send `NOTIFICATIONS ON transactions` via SMS
4. Enable 2FA: Send `ENABLE 2FA` via SMS
5. Send tokens: `SEND 0.1 TOKEN TO RECIPIENT_ADDRESS`
